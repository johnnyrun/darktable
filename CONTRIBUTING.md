## Code

Before you spend a lot of time working on a new feature, it's always best to
discuss your proposed changes with us first.  The best place to do that is in
our IRC channel on **irc.freenode.net**, channel **#darktable** or the
development mailing list, [see here for more
information](http://www.darktable.org/contact/).  This will dramatically
improve your chances of having your code merged, especially if we think you'll
hang around to maintain it.
