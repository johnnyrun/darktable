B<darktable-generate-cache> updates darktable's thumbnail cache.

=over

=item B<-h, --help>

Gives usage information and terminates.

=item B<--version>

Gives copyright and version information and terminates.

=item B<< -m, --max-mip <0-7> >>

B<darktable> can handle and store thumbnails with up to eight different resolution steps for each image.
This parameter defines which maximum resolution should be generated and defaults to B<2>.
There is normally no need to generate all possible resolutions here; missing ones will be automatically generated by darktable the moment they are needed.

=item B<< --core <darktable options>  >>

All command line parameters following B<--core> are passed
to the darktable core and handled as standard parameters.
See L<darktable(1)|darktable(1)> for a detailed description of the options.
